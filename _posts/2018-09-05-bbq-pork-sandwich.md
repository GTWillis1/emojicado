    1. First make the **barbecue sauce**: Heat oil in a frying or sauce pan, add onion and garlic with some seasoning and the brown sugar, and fry for 5 minutes until softened. Add paprika and stir to combine. Cook for 10-15 minutes until onion is caramelizing, then add vinegar and let it cook out for a few minutes. Add Worcestershire sauce and ketchup, mix well and continue to cook for about 8 minutes until sauce has reduced to a thick consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove from heat and set aside.
    2. While the barbecue sauce is reducing, start preparing the **burger mince**. If you can't find pre-minced pork, you can use a food processor to mince it. Freeze the pork and blade of your food processor for at least 30 minutes before blitzing together a few times. Set aside.
    3. Fry your minced bacon for about 5 minutes until almost cooked through. Add the shallot and cook for 5 minutes until it is tender and the bacon is crisp. Sprinkle in smoked paprika and mix well. Continue to cook for 1-2 minutes, then remove from heat, draining excess fat on a paper towel.
    4. Mix the cooked shallot and bacon into the minced pork. Shape into balls the size of golf balls. Heat a large, heavy-based frying pan. Do not grease or oil the pan.
    5. Place your patties in the pan and smash very flat and thin with a spatula or, ideally, a standard [plastering trowel](http://a.co/d/1mO90EX), if you have one to cook with.
    6. Season the patties liberally with salt and pepper. After about 1-2 minutes, scrape the patties up with your spatula or a [heavy-duty scraper with a four-inch razor blade](http://a.co/d/06qx7G0).
    7. Top each patty with a slice of cheese, turn off heat, cover, and leave to rest in the pan, allowing the cheese to melt slightly.
    8. Assemble sandwiches in buns, layered with lettuce, tomato slices, and barbecue sauce (any remaining sauce will keep well in the fridge). Serve immediately.

This is one of my favorite recent recipes. I developed it using [this Gordon Ramsay recipe](https://youtu.be/tXS0RdlqhTo) as a base. His sauce is amazing and I've slightly increased the brown sugar a bit to bring out caramelized flavor. I've also made mine full-sized sandwiches instead of sliders and smashed the patties like a traditional [smashed burger](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/03/the-food-lab-maximize-flavor-by-ultra-smashin.html) which gives the meat a beautiful caramelized crust. You can store the left over sauce in the fridge for a month or so. These go wonderfully with potato salad or salt & vinegar chips.
