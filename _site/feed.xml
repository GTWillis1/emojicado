I developed it using &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/tXS0RdlqhTo&quot;&gt;this Gordon Ramsay recipe&lt;/a&gt; as a base. His sauce is amazing and I’ve slightly increased the brown sugar a bit to bring out caramelized flavor. I’ve also made mine full-sized sandwiches instead of sliders and smashed the patties like a traditional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/03/the-food-lab-maximize-flavor-by-ultra-smashin.html&quot;&gt;smashed burger&lt;/a&gt; which gives the meat a beautiful caramelized crust.

These go wonderfully with potato salad or salt &amp;amp; vinegar chips.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is one of my favorite recent recipes.
